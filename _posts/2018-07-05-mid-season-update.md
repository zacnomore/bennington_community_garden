## Hi everyone!



The garden is looking fantastic! I’ve spoken to multiple people about how much it’s really bloomed in the past week or so. I would go out on a limb and say that we’re doing even better than last season - keep up the great work everyone!

Just some quick updates:

  - The composting tumbler is coming! Look out for it in the coming weeks - more info to come from Zac on the ins and outs of composting. One of our compost bins is also finished (yay!) so feel free to take some to nourish your plants. Please **do not** add anything more to the bin that has the “finished compost” sign in it - add it to the bin that has the “add compost” sign!
  - There will be a work day **next Wednesday** at **5:00 pm**. Hopefully it won’t rain this time - fingers crossed! 

That’s all for now, enjoy!
