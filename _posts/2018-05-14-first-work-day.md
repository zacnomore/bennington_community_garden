## The first work day was a success!

On Sunday, a crew of us met for the first time this season at the garden itself and began cleaning and preparing it for opening day! 

During the fast-and-furious work period that we had, we prepared the soil for tilling, measured our plots, sifted through the compost to begin readying our compost area for our new compost tumbler, planned out where the perennials would be placed and what they would be, and cleaned the tool shed! It was hugely productive and we are feeling ready for opening day. Here are some highlights from our work:

 1. We will be planting blueberries, rhubarb, and asparagus as our perennials. 
 2. There is one active compost bin currently - please place compost ONLY in the bin marked with the blue sign. 
 3. In the coming days, the town will till the soil and we will be able to properly map out the placement of plots. Look for plot assignment to be on the website! We will also be letting everyone know how many plots remain available. 
 4. Lastly, keep your eyes peeled for an opening day announcement - should be any day now!

    That's all for now - check back soon!
