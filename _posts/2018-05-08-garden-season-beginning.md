## Season #2 has begun

Hi everyone! Although it's not quite time to start planting in the garden yet, we are happy to have started planning this year's garden season! It is going to be a really great one. 

As a committee, we have met two times to discuss the upcoming season. We are currently in the process of getting our soil tested via our local UVM Extension's office - this will help us determine what we can do to organically help our soil so that our plants really thrive and get the nutrients that they need this year. 

We are busy planning fun events for everyone to join in on - please check back with our calendar frequently to see planned events! We are also getting a new rotating drum composter any day now which will help quicken our composting process. 

That's all for now, but please explore the website and e-mail us if you have any questions or comments! We are SO looking forward to gardening with everyone this year!
