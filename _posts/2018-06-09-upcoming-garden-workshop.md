## We're off to a great start!

Hi everyone! The garden is in full swing, and it is looking great!

Registration for plots are now closed. Thanks to all who have signed up, this season is looking busier than ever! It's great to see all of the activity going on each day in the garden. 

Just as a reminder, we will be having a work day on <b>Wednesday, June 13th</b> at <b>5:00 pm</b>. Hope to see everyone there! 

That's all for now, but if there are any questions feel free to reach out.
